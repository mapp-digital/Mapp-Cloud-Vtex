## Configuration

### Using VTEX App Store

1. Access the **Apps** section in your account's admin page and look for the Mapp Cloud Integration box;
2. Then, click on the **Install** button;
3. Under `Apps` you'll find the entry `Mapp Cloud Integration` - there you can enter your credentials (Tag Integration ID, Custom Responder Domain if available, Mapp Acquire Script);
4. Click on **Save**.

### Using VTEX IO Toolbelt

1. [Install](https://vtex.io/docs/recipes/development/installing-an-app/) the `mapppartneruk.mapp-cloud@1.x` app. You can confirm that the app has now been installed by running `vtex ls` again.

4. After pressing **Save** button you should get confirmation that everything is configured correctly
5. In order to provide realtime client/user changes to MappEngage its necessary to configure triggers in Master Data (Check next section).

### Mapp Engage configuration - Master Data Client triggers

First we have to add additional field on CL DataEntity

1. Go to **{vtex-account}.ds.vtexcrm.com.br**
2. Navigate to **Data Entities** page
3. Press to **edit icon** next to CL (Cliente) row
4. Press on **new field** button and set this values (you have to press gear icon next to new field to see all settings)

5. Press **Save** button at the bottom of the page
6. Navigate back to **Data Entities** page
7. Press **Publish** (save/disc icon) on CL (Cliente) row
8. Popup should appear. Press Ok (Make sure you're editing Cliente-CL entity)

Now we have to setup some triggers

1. Go to **{vtex-account}.ds.vtexcrm.com.br**
2. Navigate to **Triggers** page
3. Click on **Add new** button in top left corner and create new triggers

Client insert trigger

- Set URL to: **{vtex-account}.myvtex.com/\_v/app/vtex-mapp-cloud/userUpdate?userId={!userId}&remove=true&email={!email}**

### Mapping data in Mapp Cloud

Once Mapp Cloud Integration is active on your Vtex store, you can map data from the global \_ti datalayer variable as parameters to your Mapp Intelligence plugin in Tag Integration.
The following data is available:

| Datalayer Variable         | Suggested mapping                                |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| \_ti.pageName              | Page &#8594; Page Name                           |
| \_ti.emailOptIn            | Visitor &#8594; E-mail-Opt-in                    |
| \_ti.customerId            | Visitor &#8594; Customer ID                      |
| \_ti.productId             | Product &#8594; Product name or ID               |
| \_ti.shoppingCartStatus    | Product &#8594; Shopping cart status             |
| \_ti.productCost           | Product &#8594; Product costs                    |
| \_ti.currency              | Product &#8594; Currency                         |
| \_ti.productName           | Product &#8594; Currency                         |
| \_ti.productCategory       | Product &#8594; Categories                       |
| \_ti.productQuantity       | Product &#8594; Product quantity                 |
| \_ti.totalOrderValue       | Product &#8594; Total order value                |
| \_ti.orderId               | Product &#8594; Order ID                         |
| \_ti.couponValue           | Product &#8594; Predefined &#8594; Voucher value |
| \_ti.numberOfSearchResults | Page &#8594; Number of search results            |
| \_ti.internalSearch        | Page &#8594; Internal search phrase              |
| \_ti.eMailSubscription     | Visitor &#8594; E-mail receiver ID               |
| \_ti.vtex                  | Original Vtex event data &#8594; Custom Plugin   |

### Subscribing to MappPageUpdate Event

Right before pageUpdate runs, a custom event called `MappPageUpdate` is dispatched, which includes the current \_ti object as detail data.  
To set it up in Tag Integration, create a new `Rule` with the following settings:

- Event type: CUSTOM_EVENT
- Eventname: MappPageUpdate
- Element: window

Now you can use the tracking data in your custom plugins.
To try it out, create a new plugin with the following code:

```javascript
console.log(
  'TI Plugin - Event log',
  ti_event,
  ti_element,
  ti_eventType,
  ti_eventCounter
)
```

Add `head` as position and assign the `MappPageUpdateRule`.
You can find the event data in `ti_event.detail`, and under `ti_event.detail.vtex` you can find all the data Vtex provides. Use this in conjunction with your TI custom plugin(s) to set up your individual tracking requirements.
